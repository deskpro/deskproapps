Make sure DeskPRO is running on your computer, and then from the app root directory run the following command.

```
npm run dev
```

The `dev` script builds your app and starts a development server which communicates with DeskPRO to install the app. Open [https://localhost/agent/?appstore.environment=development](http://localhost/agent/?appstore.environment=development) when the the `dev` command finishes building to view the finished app.
